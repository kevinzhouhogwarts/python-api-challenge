## Method
The supplied code for generating latitudes and longitudes and for identifying the cities closest to those coordinate pairs was used.

For the OpenWeatherMap API, the 5 day weather forecast API was chosen, since it provided both a maximum temperature and the country code. Instead of requesting all 40 possible forecasts within the 5 day period used for each API request, the query parameter cnt was changed to request just 1 for brevity.

## Conclusions
